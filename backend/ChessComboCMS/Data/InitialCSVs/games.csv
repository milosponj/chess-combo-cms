d5 2.Nf3 e6 3.e3 c5 4.c4 Nc6 5.Nc3 Nf6 6.dxc5 {Tartakower:
Less consistent than 6.a3 or 6.Bd3, maintaining as long as
possible the tension in the center.} Bxc5 7.a3 a6 8.b4 Bd6
9.Bb2 O-O 10.Qd2 {? Schlechter: A very bad place for the
queen. The best continuation is 10.cxd5 exd5 11.Be2, followed
by O-O. *** Tartakower: Loss of time. The queen will soon have
to seek a better square (14.Qe2). The most useful move is
10.Qc2.} Qe7 {! Schlechter: A fine sacrifice of a pawn. If
11.cxd5 exd5 12.Nxd5? Nxd5 13.Qxd5 Rd8! and Black has a strong
attack.} 11.Bd3 {Schlechter: Better was 11.cxd5 exd5 12.Be2.}
dxc4 12.Bxc4 b5 13.Bd3 Rd8 14.Qe2 Bb7 15.O-O Ne5 {!
Schlechter: Introduced by Marshall and Schlechter in a similar
position with opposite colors, but here with the extra move
Rd8.} 16.Nxe5 Bxe5 {Tartakower: Threatening to win a pawn by
17...Bxh2+ 18.Kxh2 Qd6+. White's next move provides against
this, but loosens the kingside defenses.} 17.f4 Bc7 18.e4 Rac8
19.e5 Bb6+ 20.Kh1 Ng4 {!} 21.Be4 {Schlechter: There is no
defense; e.g., 21.Bxh7+ Kxh7 22.Qxg4 Rd2 etc.; or 21.h3 Qh4
22.Qxg4 Qxg4 23.hxg4 Rxd3, threatening ...Rh3 mate and
...Rxc3; or 21.Qxg4 Rxd3 22.Ne2 Rc2 23.Bc1 g6! threatening
...h5; or 21.Ne4 Qh4 22.h3 (if 22.g3 Qxh2+ 23.Qxh2 Nxh2 and
wins.) 22....Rxd3 23.Qxd3 Bxe4 24.Qxe4 Qg3 25.hxg4 Qh4+ mate.}
Qh4 22.g3 {Schlechter: Or 22.h3 Rxc3! 23.Bxc3 Bxe4 24.Qxg4
Qxg4 25.hxg4 Rd3 wins. *** Tartakower: The alternative 22.h3,
parrying the mate, would lead to the following brilliant lines
of play: 22...Rxc3! (an eliminating sacrifice, getting rid of
the knight, which overprotects the bishop on e4) 23.Bxc3 (or
23.Qxg4 Rxh3+ 24.Qxh3 Qxh3+ 25.gxh3 Bxe4+ 26.Kh2 Rd2+ 27.Kg3

24.Qxe4 Qg3 25.hxg4 Qh4+ mate) 24...Qxg4 25.hxg4 Rd3 with the
double threat of 26...Rh3+ mate and 26....Rxc3, and Black
wins. Beautiful as are these variations, the continuation in
the text is still more splendid.} Rxc3 {!!} 23.gxh4 Rd2 {!!}

1.Nf3 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2.c4 e6 {As for the merit of this
system of defence, compare the game Reti vs. Yates in the
sixth round.} 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Bd6 5.O-O O-O 6.b3 Re8 7.Bb2 Nbd7
8.d4 {To our way of thinking, this is the clear positional
refutation of 2...e6, which, by the way, was first played by
Capablanca (as Black) against Marshall and is based upon the
simple circumstance that Black cannot find a method for the
effective development of his Queen's Bishop.} c6 9.Nbd2 {In
the game referred to, Capablanca, in a wholly analogous
position, played ...Ne4 and likewise obtained an advantage
thereby. Of course, Reti's quieter development is also quite
good.} Ne4 {If the liberating move of 9...e5, recommended by
Rubinstein and others, is really the best here-then it
furnishes the most striking proof that Black's entire
arrangement of his game was faulty. For the simple
continuation 10.cxd5 cxd5 11.dxe5 Nxe5 12.Nxe5 Bxe5 13.Bxe5
Rxe5 14.Nc4 Re8 15.Ne3 Be6 16.Qd4, would have given White a
direct attack against the isolated Queen's pawn, without
permitting the opponent any chances whatsoever. Moreover, the
move selected by Bogoljubow leads eventually to a double
exchange of Knights, without moving the principal disadvantage
of his position.} 10.Nxe4 dxe4 11.Ne5 f5 {Obviously forced.}
12.f3 {The proper strategy. After Black has weakened his
position in the center, White forthwith must aim to change the
closed game into an open one in order to make as much as
possible out of that weakness.} exf3 13.Bxf3 {Not 13.exf3,
because the e pawn must be utilized as a battering ram.} Qc7
{Also after 13...Nxe5 14.dxe5 Bc5+ 15.Kg2 Bd7 (after the
exchange of Queens, this Bishop could not get out at all)
16.e4, White would have retained a decisive advantage in
position.} 14.Nxd7 Bxd7 15.e4 e5 {Otherwise would follow
16.e5, to be followed by a break by means of d5 or g4. After
the text move, however, Black appears to have surmounted the
greater part of his early difficulty and it calls for
exeptionally fine play on the part of White in order to make
the hidden advantages of his position count so rapidly and
convincingly.} 16.c5 Bf8 17.Qc2 {Attacking simultaneously both
of Black's center pawns.} exd4 {Black's sphere of action is
circumscribed; for instance, 17...fxe4 clearly would not do on
account of the two-fold threat against h7 and e5, after
18.Bxe4} 18.exf5 Rad8 {After 18...Re5 19.Qc4+ Kh8 20.f6, among
other lines, would be very strong.} 19.Bh5 {The initial move
in an exactly calculated, decisive manouver, the end of which
will worthily crown White's model play.} Re5 20.Bxd4 Rxf5 {If
20...Rd5 21.Qc4 Kh8 22.Bg4, with a pawn plus and a superior
position.} 21.Rxf5 Bxf5 22.Qxf5 Rxd4 23.Rf1 Rd8 {Or 23...Qe7
24.Bf7+ Kh8 25.Bd5 Qf6 26.Qc8, etc. Black is left without any
defence.} 24.Bf7+ Kh8 25.Be8 {A sparkling conclusion! Black
resigned, for, after 25...Bxc5+, he loses at least the
Bishop. Rightfully, this game was awarded the first brilliancy
prize.} 1-0","1924-04-01 22:00:00+00",2,18,"Reti is known as a great composer of endgame studies but in this magnificent win there was no need for an endgame.
